# Kixie PowerCall: Boost Sales with AI-Powered Dialing, Seamless CRM Integration, 400% Higher Connection Rates

You know that feeling when you're dialing through a contact list and every call goes straight to voicemail? Or worse—when prospects see "Spam Risk" on their caller ID and never even give you a chance?

That's the reality of modern sales calling. But here's the thing: a growing number of sales teams have found a way around this problem. They're connecting with 4x more prospects, dropping their response times from 35 minutes to under 10, and doing it all without hiring more people.

The tool making this happen is called Kixie.

## What Is Kixie, Really?

Kixie is a sales engagement platform built around one core idea: your sales team shouldn't waste time on busywork when they could be talking to actual humans.

It's essentially a supercharged phone and texting system that plugs directly into your CRM—whether that's HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, or any of the other 25+ platforms it integrates with. You're not jumping between different software windows. You're just working inside the tools you already use, except now every phone number becomes clickable, and all your activity logs itself automatically.

The platform was founded in 2013 and is based in Los Angeles. For two years running (2023 and 2024), it's ranked in G2's Top 50 Sales Products—landing at #14 in 2024 out of over 700 products in the category.

## The Core Features That Actually Matter

**Multi-Line PowerDialer**

Most dialers call one number at a time. Kixie's PowerDialer can dial up to 10 leads simultaneously. When someone picks up, you're connected instantly. The AI skips voicemails and IVRs automatically, so you're only talking to real people.

The math is simple: if a manual dialer gets you 40 calls per hour and a standard power dialer gets you 80, Kixie's multi-line approach can push that to 300+ calls per hour.

**AI-Powered Local Presence (ConnectionBoost)**

Here's where it gets interesting. Kixie has a pool of over 50,000 real phone numbers. When you call someone, the system automatically displays a local area code matching theirs.

So if you're calling a prospect in San Francisco (415 area code), they see a 415 number on their caller ID—not some random out-of-state number that screams "telemarketer."

But it doesn't stop there. The AI continuously monitors which numbers are performing well and which are getting flagged as spam. If a number's connection rate drops, the system automatically swaps it out for a fresh one. You never show up as "Spam Risk" because the platform is constantly maintaining number reputation in the background.

Progressive Caller ID takes this further: if you call the same prospect multiple times, the system shows a different local number each time. No "stalker effect" from the same number calling repeatedly.

Studies show this can increase connection rates by up to 500%.

**Conversation Intelligence**

The platform records calls and uses AI to analyze them. It tracks keywords, sentiment, and generates automatic summaries that sync directly to your CRM. Sales managers can coach reps in real-time by "whispering" advice during live calls.

**SMS Integration**

You can text directly from the platform using templates with dynamic fields. After leaving a voicemail, the system can automatically send a follow-up text like "Hey, just missed you—calling about X."

**Voicemail Drop**

Instead of waiting through the beep and leaving the same message 50 times a day, you pre-record your messages. When you hit voicemail, one click drops the recording and moves you to the next call.

## What Real Users Are Saying

The reviews are mixed but generally positive, with most praise focusing on specific use cases.

**The Good Stuff:**

One insurance sales professional shared: *"I started using Kixie approximately 2 years ago for my outbound insurance sales job. I am utterly dependent on it now, my business would be far less efficient without it."*

A VP of Sales noted: *"Within three months of using Kixie, we dropped our time to first call from around 35 minutes down to 9 minutes. In turn, this increased our conversion rate tremendously!"*

Another user emphasized the local presence feature: *"I was looking for a dialer that would allow us to call our leads with a local presence. Most companies charge an astronomical number for this or ask that you purchase numbers in specific area codes but Kixie does it automatically with the flip of a switch."*

**The Challenges:**

Some users report technical issues. One review on TrustPilot stated: *"The dialer works half the time, and sometimes you can hear the client, sometimes you can't. You have to reset the sound after every call or you'll have dead air."*

Customer support responsiveness varies. While many praise the support team's knowledge and helpfulness, others mention delays ranging from several days between responses.

Pricing concerns come up for small businesses. Several reviewers note the cost can be steep for teams with limited budgets, and there's no refund policy.

The G2 rating sits at 4.7 out of 5 stars based on verified user reviews.

## Who Should Actually Use Kixie?

**Great fit if you:**
- Run high-volume outbound sales operations
- Need tight CRM integration (especially HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive)
- Struggle with low answer rates on cold calls
- Want to reduce time spent on manual dialing and logging
- Need local presence dialing without buying expensive number pools

**Maybe look elsewhere if you:**
- Primarily need inbound customer support features
- Require video conferencing and team chat in one platform
- Only make occasional calls (the value comes from volume)
- Need a standalone CRM rather than just calling tools
- Operate internationally with heavy calling outside US/Canada

## The Bottom Line

Kixie isn't trying to be everything to everyone. It's specifically built for sales teams that need to make a lot of calls and connect with actual humans—not voicemail boxes.

The local presence technology and multi-line dialing are where it really shines. If your main problem is that people aren't answering your calls, this is designed to solve exactly that problem.

The CRM integration means your reps aren't switching between platforms all day. They work inside HubSpot or Salesforce like normal, except now they can dial 10 people at once and have everything logged automatically.

Is it perfect? No. Some users report technical hiccups, and the pricing can add up once you factor in add-ons like ConnectionBoost and Conversation Intelligence. But for teams doing serious outbound volume, the productivity gains seem to more than offset the cost.

The 7-day free trial gives you enough time to test whether it actually improves your team's connection rates. Given that some users report doubling their conversations per day, it's probably worth taking for a spin.
